1. First Generation (1940s-1950s):
   - Early computers had no operating systems; programs were manually loaded using switches and dials.
   - Examples: ENIAC, UNIVAC I.

2. Second Generation (Late 1950s-1960s):
   - Batch processing systems emerged, allowing multiple jobs to be executed sequentially without user intervention.
   - Examples: IBM OS/360, Burroughs MCP.

3. Third Generation (1960s-1970s):
   - Time-sharing systems enabled multiple users to interact with a computer simultaneously, each with their session.
   - Multiprogramming improved resource utilization by allowing several programs to reside in memory concurrently.
   - Examples: UNIX, Multics, IBM OS/370.

4. Fourth Generation (1970s-1980s):
   - Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were introduced, making computers more accessible to non-technical users.
   - Personal computers (PCs) became popular, leading to operating systems tailored for individual users.
   - Examples: Microsoft Windows (1.0-3.11), Apple Macintosh System Software.

5. Fifth Generation (1980s-Present):
   - Advancements in networking and distributed computing led to the development of networked and distributed operating systems.
   - Real-time operating systems (RTOS) emerged, catering to time-sensitive applications like embedded systems and industrial control.
   - Examples: Linux, Windows NT/XP/10, macOS, Android, iOS.

Each generation brought significant advancements in functionality, performance, and usability, shaping the evolution of modern operating systems.
